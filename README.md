# Soltrain

I was playing a little solitaire for nostalgia's sake and realized I didn't know
any optimal strategy. Whilst the internet provides plenty of written guides, to
my surprise I could not find an interactive trainer to provide move-by-move
feedback as is my preferred learning method. So I'm making it myself.

Currently, soltrain is just a minimal but functional mobile solitaire game
created with React Native and the next step will be to calculate optimal plays
and display turn-by-turn feedback when the player makes mistakes.
